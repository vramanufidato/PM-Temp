Strategic Lifecycle Management: Hybrid PMP/Agile Framework

A Case Study in Resilience, Resource Management, and Technical Upskilling
📌 Project Overview

This repository serves as a professional case study demonstrating the application of Project Management Institute (PMI) standards and Agile methodologies to manage a complex life transition.

The project involves balancing three high-priority workstreams—Health Stabilization, Primary Caregiving, and Professional Upskilling—under significant resource constraints (energy, time, and health).

🛠 Project Framework: The Hybrid Approach
I utilized a Hybrid Model to ensure both long-term structural integrity and short-term operational flexibility:

Waterfall: Used for foundational governance (Charter, WBS, Risk Registry).

Agile (Scrum/Kanban): Used for execution, allowing for variable "velocity" based on health-related capacity.

📂 Repository Structure
1. Initiating & Planning (Waterfall)
Project_Charter.md: Defines the "Ready to Work" goal, success metrics, and high-level constraints.

WBS_Dictionary.md: Breaks down the three pillars (Recovery, Care, Upskilling) into manageable work packages.

Risk_Registry.xlsx: Outlines "Known-Unknowns" (e.g., health relapses) with proactive mitigation and contingency plans.

2. Execution & Monitoring (Agile)
Sprint_Backlogs/: Weekly prioritized tasks for [Target Skill, e.g., Data Science/Cloud].

Communication_Matrix.md: Stakeholder management plan for medical, familial, and professional circles.

Retrospective_Logs.md: Bi-weekly analysis of "What worked, what failed, and what to adjust."

📈 Applied PMP Knowledge Areas
Resource Management: Managing "Cognitive Load" as a finite resource through capacity planning.

Risk Management: Transitioning personal health challenges into "Project Risks" to remove emotional bias and apply logical solutions.

Schedule Management: Utilizing a rolling-wave planning technique to ensure progress during low-energy periods.

🚀 Key Learning & Outcomes
Resilience: Demonstrated the ability to maintain project governance during high-stress volatility.

Adaptability: Successfully pivoted learning paths based on Sprint Retrospective data.

Tools Used: [Jira]

## About this course

In this final, capstone course of the Google Project Management Certificate, you will practice applying the project management knowledge and skills you have learned so far. We encourage learners to complete Courses 1-5 before beginning the final course, as they provide the foundation necessary to complete the activities in this course. 

As you progress through this course, you will “observe” a project manager in a real-world scenario and complete dozens of hands-on activities. You will:
- analyze project documents to identify project requirements and evaluate stakeholders 
- complete a project charter and use it as a tool to align project scope and goals among stakeholders
- identify tasks and milestones and document and prioritize them in a project plan
- define quality management standards and explore how to effectively share qualitative data
- demonstrate your project’s impact through effective reporting 

By the end of this course, you will have developed a portfolio of project management artifacts that will demonstrate the skills you have learned throughout the entire program, such as your ability to manage stakeholders and teams, organize plans, and communicate project details. These artifacts can exhibit your career readiness when applying for jobs in the field. To further prepare you to interview for project management jobs, you will reflect on past projects, develop an “elevator pitch,” and anticipate common interview questions. Current Google project managers will continue to instruct and provide you with the strategies, tools, and resources to meet your goals.

After completing this program, you should be equipped to apply for introductory-level jobs as a project manager. You will also have the opportunity to claim a certification of completion badge that will be recognizable to employers.

#### What you'll learn

- Complete a project charter, filling out key information including a project summary, SMART goals, scope, benefits, and costs.

- Examine project documentation and conduct research to identify tasks for a project and organize those project tasks and milestones in a project plan.

- Determine quality standards and evaluate against those standards to ensure that the project is achieving the required level of quality.

- Develop effective stakeholder reports by applying storytelling strategies to describe data.

#### There are 4 modules in this course

**Module-1 : Initiating a project**

You will learn to analyze project documents and supporting materials to identify project requirements, evaluate stakeholders, and problem-solve. You’ll complete a project charter and use it as a tool to align project scope and goals among stakeholders. You will also add specificity to project goals to make them SMART and apply effective negotiation skills with stakeholders to prioritize project goals.

**Module-2 : Building out a project plan**

You will examine project documentation, conduct online research, and analyze key conversations to identify tasks and milestones and then document and prioritize them in a project plan. You will also demonstrate effective communication techniques for making accurate time estimates for project tasks.


**Module-3 : Maintaining quality**

You will learn to define and describe quality management standards and evaluate against those standards to ensure that the project is achieving the required level of quality. You will distinguish evaluation questions from survey questions and recognize how to effectively share qualitative data. You will also learn strategies to facilitate a productive retrospective by encouraging participation, accountability, and positivity.

**Module-4 : Effective stakeholder communication**

You will learn to communicate and escalate project problems to stakeholders and to demonstrate your impact through effective reporting strategies. Additionally, you will prepare for job interviews in the field by reflecting on past projects, developing an “elevator pitch,” and anticipating common questions.
